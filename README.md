This project is for a competition of [USTC](ustc.edu). We hope students can develop various AIs for this wonderful game.

We'll provide a platform for AIs to fight with each other.


**Here's some markable standard for winners (optional):**

* Get the highest score while provided with enough time for thinking. (For example, 30sec/step)
* Get the highest score while provided with little time for thinking. (For example, 1sec/step)
* Without pre-training or pre-searching
* Scalable (Brute-force search will fail it)
* Uncommon or surprising methods
* *Other targets will be added later*


Your are honorable if matching any of these requests.
